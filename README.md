# Malachor: Ruins

_**NOTE: Those files are only useful for modders.**_

## Malachor: Ruins is a Battlefront 2 (2005) custom made map. 

The reason I am sharing the map files on github is to try to centralise the work and to have only one 'master' version of the map being worked on. Having a cluster of different versions going around could be confusing and I think it's best to avoid it. If you have never used github before I encourage you to follow the quick tutorial available when you create your account.

#### Basically, from my understanding of github:
- Features ideas go in the issues tab.
- If you want to tackle an issue, you 'assign' yourself to it in the issues tab, this lets everyone else know you are working on it.
- Whenever you start working on a new feature, you branch out from the master version. This lets you work on your version while leaving the master version in a stable state.
- Once your work is finished you can pull it back into the master version and the master version essentially becomes your version.

You might also want to download the desktop version of github.

It is my first time using github so I hope this goes smoothly and apologies if things are not working as expected.

#### Here is a list of features that could be added to the map based on feedback from players and based on what I believe would improve the map:

- A campaign where the clones arrive on malachor to invade it and defeat the sith (could have it the other way around where the user plays as the sith defending a surprise attack from the jedis).
- 1-flag and 2-flags modes. (1-flag mode is mostly done but I did not include it in the final release as I did not like the way the AI behaved and it also felt a bit rough).
- Assault mode (suggested by Ataru).
- Survival mode (suggested by LitFam).
- Mode with sith (red lightsabers only) vs jedis (similar to assault but having it as conquest could be interesting).
- For conquest, a subtle change of the sides' skins could be interesting. And of course custom made heroes could be pretty cool too. (Naelis' Revan as a hero would be dope)
- Compatibility with different eras and modes.
- Sound design and sound fixes. I struggle to understand how sounds work in swbf2, and could not do it myself. Anyways I was thinking a custom music could be cool, and it would also be great to fix the missing wind for gcw and the lightsabers sounds (while making sure the footsteps are working too).
- I have also been made aware of some performance issues on older devices. This is (I believe) because the map is poorly optimised with no lowrez textures, shadows and mshs.

Feel free to submit issues in the issues tab if you have other ideas.
