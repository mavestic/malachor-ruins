# Malachor: Ruins
Malachor: Ruins is a Battlefront 2 (2005) cutom made map. 

The reason I am sharing the map privately is to make sure only one 'master' version of the map is being worked on and going around. What I want to prevent is the release of a cluster of seperate versions that are either unfinished or badly made.

Whatever feature you want to add, please make sure you do not change the map's atmosphere and the map's design (at least for the original conquest mode). Make sure the changes you make are improvements over what has already been made.

Here is a list of features that could be added to the map based on feedback from players and based on what I believed would improve the map:

- a campaign where the clones arrive on malachor to invade it and defeat the sith.
- 1-flag and 2-flags modes. (1-flag mode is mostly done but I did not include it in the final release as I did not like the way the AI behaved).
- assault mode.
- mode with sith vs jedis (similar to assault but conquest could be interesting).
- compatibility with different eras and modes.
- sound design and sound fixes. I struggle to understand how sound works in swbf2, so I could not do it myself. However I was thinking a custom music could be cool, and it would also be great to fix the missing wind for gcw and the lightsabers sounds (while making sure the footsteps are working too).
