# Malachor: Ruins
Malachor: Ruins is a Battlefront 2 (2005) cutom made map. 

Now that the map is finished (aside from the sound bugs which need to be fixed) the next part is to add contents. Contents like eras, modes, and sides.

The reason I am sharing the map privately and on github is to make sure only one 'master' version of the map is being worked on and going around. What I want to prevent is the release of a cluster of separate versions that are either unfinished or badly made.

It is my first time using github so I hope this goes smoothly and apologies if things are not working as expected.

Whatever feature you want to add, please try not change the map's atmosphere and the map's design. Make sure the changes you make are improvements over what has already been made.

Here is a list of features that could be added to the map based on feedback from players and based on what I believe would improve the map:

- a campaign where the clones arrive on malachor to invade it and defeat the sith (could have it the other way around where the user plays as the sith defending a surprise attack from the jedis).
- 1-flag and 2-flags modes. (1-flag mode is mostly done but I did not include it in the final release as I did not like the way the AI behaved).
- assault mode.
- mode with sith vs jedis (similar to assault but having it as conquest could be interesting).
- for conquest, a subtle change of the sides' skins could be interesting. And of course custom made heroes could be pretty cool too. (Revan as a hero could be added) 
- compatibility with different eras and modes.
- sound design and sound fixes. I struggle to understand how sounds work in swbf2, and could not do it myself. Anyways I was thinking a custom music could be cool, and it would also be great to fix the missing wind for gcw and the lightsabers sounds (while making sure the footsteps are working too).
